  - Name and location are all that are required to register. No address, birth date, gender, etc are needed.
- Control over personal email alerts

## User groups

  - Schedule events
  - Polls
  - Forum page
  - Email announcements (sent from Meetup, email addresses are hidden)
- Allows Techlahoma to automate operations based on events created:

# On-boarding a user group
## 1. Create a Meetup group
If the user group already has a meetup, skip to [2. Make Techlahoma the organizer and the user group leader co-organizer.](#2-make-techlahoma-the-organizer-and-the-user-group-leader-co-organizer)

### 1.a Go to [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), log in to Techlahoma's account, and click "Create a Meetup"
New meetups need to be created from Techlahoma's Meetup account so that Techlahoma may cover the initial Meetup service charges. If you do not have access to Techlahoma's Meetup account, contact a member of the board for access or to create the meetup for the user group in mind.

### 1.b Complete the new meetup form
Form questions will be similar to the following:
- Which town will your Meetup events be based?
- What is your Meetup about?
- What will your Meetup's name be?
- Who should join and what will your group do?

### 1.c Customize the meetup
The meetup is created! Meetup will guide you through a few more steps to customize it.

## 2. Make Techlahoma the organizer and the user group leader co-organizer
If the meetup was made from Techlahoma's account then Techlahoma should already be organizer and you can skip ahead to [2.c Make previous meetup organizer the co-organizer](#2c-make-previous-meetup-organizer-the-co-organizer). The user group leader should be co-organizer, which is organizer minus the billing.

Here is a list of member roles for reference:
