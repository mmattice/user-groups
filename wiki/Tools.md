### [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/)
Techlahoma leaders use LastPass to share account access without actually sharing passwords. Account owners through LastPass can revoke credentials from other LastPass users they previously shared with.

Why would a user group leader want to use LastPass?
* So Techlahoma can connect to your social media accounts via Buffer.

### [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)
We like using Buffer for scheduling and approving social media content for select platforms. Buffer also has a great permissions set up so that UG leaders and volunteers can only post to social media accounts that they were approved for.
Social media forms Buffer can connect to:
* Twitter
* Facebook (profile, page, and group)
* LinkedIn (profile and page)
* Google+ (page only, not profile)
* Pinterest
* Instagram

Why would a user group leader want to use Buffer?
* Schedule social media announcements in advance
* Connect to multiple accounts and queue up multiple posts on Techlahoma's dime.

Why might a user group leader hesitate?
* Social media account credentials must be shared with Techlahoma in order to connect to them on Buffer. Using LastPass to share credentials should still protect privacy and give UG leaders power to revoke Techlahoma's access if they choose to.
