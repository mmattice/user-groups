To use Venmo to request reimbursement:
* Create a [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) account.
* Select Charge.
* Type "techlahoma" in the "To:" field, and select the Techlahoma Foundation.
* Enter the amount and the reason for reimbursement (include a link to the GitHub issue if there is one).
* Click the Charge button.

A copy of the receipt *must* be submitted based on the type of reimbursement:
* If the reimbursement is for User Group Food and Drink, the requirements on the [Food and Drink](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/wiki/Food-and-Drinks) wiki page must be met, and a receipt submitted on GitHub. Close the GitHub issue when reimbursement has been made.
* If the reimbursement is for something other than User Group Food and Drink, a receipt must be submitted to the Treasurer either through a [Xero expense report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-HRgqKCveFYpqSRxMjAVj-B2sNeNw3p_qK0jo4OYgU/edit?usp=sharing) if you have a Xero account, or by emailing the [Treasurer](mailto:payments@techlahoma.org) a copy of the receipt.
