The leaders of all user groups that meet at StarSpace46 must agree to the [StarSpace46 User Group Leader Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10wtP8VqrHo_Sb0s-d4veaOeGsrfVz7Dlnmx4Ykn61FE)

Please promote StarSpace46 on social media and link from your user group website to the [StarSpace46](http://www.starspace46.com/) website.

If your user group is meeting at StarSpace46, reservations there will not be completed until your event is scheduled on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/). Include the [parking map](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57422f09ab48dec01e5e20c7/t/588fb33ee3df2828e8ceb5ab/1485814862865/ss46parking) on the meetup page. It's also available at http://www.starspace46.com/events and http://www.starspace46.com/contact.

Techlahoma doesn't have unlimited credit hours with StarSpace46, and we would like to onboard more user groups, so please limit the meetup to less than three hours. You can see the booking information in the GitHub [scheduling](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/labels/scheduling) issue. If StarSpace46 has been booked for longer than you need, please make a comment on the issue.

If your meetup is in the Holodeck, tell attendees to use the south door.

If your meetup is in the event space, tell attendees to use the west entrance instead of the south door. Before the meetup, open the west gate and watch the door for food delivery and attendees. Close the west gate and verify that the outside door is fully closed after the meetup.

If you would like to use the projectors in the event space and/or have the meetup streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma), please ask whether a volunteer is available at least one week ahead of time. The current streaming volunteers are Ava (`@avasond` in the Techlahoma Slack and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avasond)) and Kimberly (`@kimberlycollins` in the Techlahoma Slack and `@kacollins` on GitHub).

Streaming is optional. If the content of the presentation is sensitive or presenters are uncomfortable with it (especially for lightning talks), the meetup doesn’t have to be streamed to Twitch.

When streaming, make sure that the microphone is turned on, and ask presenters to turn off display tools like [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

You don’t need to bring plates, cups, or utensils to StarSpace46. Plates and napkins are on the shelves above the kitchen sink.

Take out the trash before you leave. There is a dumpster right outside the event space's east door. Trash bags are under the sink in the kitchen.

The Starspace 46 guest password is `Techlahoma`.
